# OrcaSound Hydrophone Processing

Puget Sound is a rich ecosystem home to several groups of resident killer whales. These orcas feed on salmon and are a big part of eco-tourism, rendering them important members of the community. Organizations like OrcaSound have dedicated resources to observing and monitoring these populations over time, building a vast dataset of visual identification and acoustic data. This repo serves as a method of accessing and processing the acoustic data from OrcaSound's many hydrophone locations.
